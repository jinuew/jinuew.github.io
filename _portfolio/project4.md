"The departure point is fixed as the first order, but the visiting order of 'waypoints' and 'waypoint2' is arranged according to the optimal route. For example, even if you choose the order as Coex Aquarium - E Cruise - Lotte World Adventure, you may receive a route recommendation in the order of Coex Aquarium - Lotte World Adventure - E Cruise, based on the efficiency of movement."
